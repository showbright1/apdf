The APDF class enables to create and export PDF documents from Flex.

There are two versions: the one that use as3corelib library for image encoding and the one that use built in class in package mx.graphics.codec (Flex 3). If you choose to use the corelib version, you will have to download as3corelib too (it is not included in the download).
